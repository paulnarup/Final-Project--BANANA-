Final Project
BANANA
	My banana final project is a translator that takes an English file and translates it to the minion language. 
It takes a list of minion to English words, separated by ‘=’, and reads them into two vectors, English words and minion words. 
It asks the user for the file and reads that file into a vector. It then finds the English words that have a minion translation and reads the file into a final vector that includes the replacements for the translated words. 
It then asks the user if they want a blank file with only the translation, or a file that includes their initial file with the translation which can be used for comparison. 

	For my data structure I used vectors. I chose vectors because they allow the same direct access as arrays do, but their size can be changed easily. 
This allows for the user to incorporate more translation words if more are discovered as well as allowing for large files to be translated. 
The direct access allows for easy changes of elements when a translation is found. It is also quick and easy to write out vectors to files to show the results of the translation. 


Step by step: 
	put minion_to_english.txt in proper folder to implement translations
	Locate the file that you wish to translate
	Put file in proper location in project folder
		for test use test.txt 
	Run program 
	Follow on screen instructions
	Open project folder for result files 
IDE and OS
	Eclipse 
	Windows 10
