Hello!I'm hungry, get me some ice cream. Thank you.
You're very ugly, let me fix your hair. Sit in this chair...Look at you, much better now.
How dare you say that I am ugly? I hate you!
I'm sorry. I'll buy you a toy, what do you want?
We'll jump on the count of three. One! Two! Three!
Goodbye.
